## Introduction
This project is my first one and I would like to write a game as a first experience.

## Installation

This is a **Game** that works like this:

1. Python choose a random number between 1 and 100 and then game starts. 
2. User guess a **number** and enter it.
3. python check the user's number:

    If user's number is higher than its number, says to user that

    "Your number is very high"

    and also if the user's number is lower than its number, says 

    "Your number is very low".

    and user enter another number.

4. This game has a score of 100. In every section that user guesses a wrong number, 10 scores will be deducated.

5. The game ends when the user guesses the correct number.

6. In the final stage, the user receives a congratulatory message and the final score and the game ends.
